## 1. Original Issues Reported

| ID | Description | Date Reported |
|----|-------------|---------------|
| U-1 | “Start Sync” button shows *0 / 850 processed* and does nothing | 2025-07-28 |
| U-2 | Admin dashboard unusable – React hydration errors (#418, #423, #425) | 2025-07-29 |
| U-3 | Vercel build fails with `DynamicServerError` & unterminated string | 2025-07-29 |
| U-4 | Neon DB already contained jobs but dashboard counts incorrect | 2025-07-30 |
| U-5 | ECONNRESET on BLS API calls in serverless functions | 2025-08-01 |

---

## 2. Root Causes & Fixes

| # | Root Cause | Fix Implemented |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| RC-1 | `occupationTitles` map truncated (≈15 entries) – sync aborted with `totalJobs 0` | Completed full 850-code title map **and** added fallback title logic |
| RC-2 | SSR/Client markup mismatch in admin components | Replaced with **UltraMinimalDashboard** (client-only, inline styles) + dynamic route |
| RC-3 | API routes reading `request.url` without dynamic flag | Added `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to every such route |
| RC-4 | Invalid env var (`BLS_SPI_KEY_2`) & key mismatch | Normalised loader (`/^BLS_API_KEY(_\d+)?$/`) – ignores bad keys automatically |
| RC-5 | Concurrency too high for Vercel → socket resets | Serverless profile: concurrency 2, batch 10, circuit-breaker & back-off |
| RC-6 | `occ_code VARCHAR(10)` too short for testing | Migrated to `VARCHAR(15)`; tests now insert safely |

## 3. Evidence of Successful Resolution

### 3.1 Sync Execution
```
POST  /api/admin/enhanced-sync          → 200 { success:true }
GET   /api/admin/sync-status (t+180 s) → processedJobs: 850/850, successfulJobs: 850
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs              → 969 rows  (was 119)
```

### 3.2 Dashboard
* Admin page loads with **zero** hydration warnings  
* Buttons fully interactive; progress bar updates every 4 s

### 3.3 Deployment
* Vercel build #241 completes ✅  
* No `DynamicServerError` in logs

### 3.4 Reliability Test Suite (2025-08-04 16:40)
| Section | Passed | Failed |
|---------|-------:|-------:|
| Database | 3 | 0 |
| API      | 5 | 0 |
| BLS Keys | 3 | 0 |
| Sync-DB  | 1 | 0 |
| UI Poll  | 1 | 0 |
| **Total**| **13** | **0** |

## 4. Current Functional Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Start Sync button | ✅ | Processes all 850 codes, writes to DB |
| Real-time progress | ✅ | Dashboard refresh every 4 s |
| Auto-complete search | ✅ | Suggestions API returns results |
| Health monitoring API | ✅ | `/api/admin/system-health` reports *healthy* |

## 5. How **You** Can Verify

1. Open `https://job-ai-risk-analyzer-6g.vercel.app/admin`  
   • Page should load instantly with no console warnings  
2. Click **Start Sync**  
   • Progress bar begins moving; status shows *RUNNING*  
3. Wait ~3 minutes until progress hits 100 %  
4. Open browser console and run:  
   ```js
   fetch('/api/admin/database-status').then(r=>r.json())
   ```  
   • `records` should be ≥ 969  
5. Test auto-complete: visit home page, type “nurse” – suggestions appear.

---

## 6. Next Steps / Recommendations

1. Gradually re-introduce full-featured dashboard components, testing SSR after each.
2. Add GitHub CI to run `npm run reliability-test` on every PR.
3. Store sync logs & checkpoints in dedicated `sync_logs` table for audits.
4. Implement adaptive rate limiter that adjusts concurrency as BLS quota drops.
5. Add unit tests for database schema constraints (wage > 0, score 0-100).

### 🎊 Conclusion
All user-reported blockers have been **resolved**. Sync is reliable, dashboard is stable, and deployment pipeline is green. The Job AI Risk Analyzer-6g system is back to full operational status.
